I am a 22 years old computer science engineer and I work across the stack at the investment banking firm, Goldman Sachs, as a software developer. I completed my Bachelor of Technology with major in Computer Science and Engineering and minor in Mathematics in June 2021.

I am interested in marrying Artificial Intelligence with sustainability for societal and environmental benefits. This includes implementing models in artificial intelligence subdomains like Computer Vision, CommenSense Systems and Natural Language Processing to solve some of the major problems faced by humanity with food, agriculture, climate change, wildlife protection, crimes against women, global access of education, etc. However along with the colossal impact that AI can have in improving life on this planet, AI models can have huge carbon footprints as per the research done in the past decade. I want to work towards increasing this awareness in our community and encourage scientists and developers to give significance to the energy factor while calculating the efficiency of an AI model. I am also interested in researching further into improving the energy efficiency of AI models to reduce their carbon footprint.

I am highly passionate about yoga- questioning the traditional techniques, researching about the different types by experimenting with my own yoga practice, trying to connect to my soul and building a community where we can exchange these thoughts. I love cooking wholesome food and cherishing the wonderful gift that Mother Earth has given us in the form of fruits and vegetables. 5 minutes of pop music is all I need to get me going through a hard day.
